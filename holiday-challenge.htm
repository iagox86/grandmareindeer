        <p><em>[Editor's Note: We've got an exciting announcement, 
challenge fans!  This year's annual Christmas Hacking Challenge is based
 on that old song <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yfs4FKbJzL0" target="_blank">Grandma Got Run Over by a Reindeer</a>.  In our telling, you'll get to analyze the evidence in detail to determine what really happened that fateful night.  In the <a href="http://www.ethicalhacker.net/content/view/285/2/" target="_blank">Miracle on Thirty-Hack Street</a>
 challenge I wrote with Kevin Johnson a couple of years ago, we referred
 to the horrible hit-and-run reindeer accident.  This year's challenge 
is set in the back story of the earlier challenge, where you'll get to 
figure out what really happened when Grandma Got All Hax0red by a 
Reindeer... Or Did She? &#8212;Ed.]</em></p>
<h3>Grandma Got All Hax0red by a Reindeer... Or Did She?</h3>
<h4>By Ed Skoudis &amp; Tom Hessman</h4>
<img src="holiday-challenge_files/grandma.png" class="align-right" height="400">
<p>"And I will now demonstrate, ladies and gentlemen of the jury, beyond
 a shadow of a doubt, that the defendant, Mr. Rudolph T. Reindeer, is 
guilty of the heinous act of... CRIMINAL HOMICIDE!" boldly announced the
 prosecutor.  The courtroom was in an uproar.  Santa buried his face in 
his hands as Mrs. Claus began to weep.  Rudolph stared ahead in stunned 
silence.  I'll never forget that tumultuous day.  If the jury accepted 
the attorney's conclusion and convicted him, Rudolph... with his nose so
 bright... wouldn't be guiding any sleighs any Christmas nights, for a 
very long time indeed.</p>
<p>This tragic set of circumstances all began on Christmas Eve during 
our family's festive holiday get-together in New York City.  Shortly 
after 9:00 PM, Grandma realized she had forgotten her medication back in
 her apartment.  Worried that she was a wee bit tipsy from rather too 
much eggnog, we begged her not to go.  But she staggered out the door, 
saying, "I'll take Cousin Mel along."</p>
<p>In truth, Mel wasn't actually our cousin.  Grandma had only recently 
met Mel, who was working as a repairman in her apartment building.  They
 became fast friends.  Because he was Grandma's friend, we all wanted to
 call him "Grandpa Mel" or "Uncle Mel".  However, Grandma insisted that 
we call him "Cousin Mel" because he was so much closer in age to us 
kids.</p>
<p>The roundtrip walk to Grandma's house through Central Park should 
have taken less than 45 minutes, even at Grandma's slow pace.  But, with
 our wild family Christmas soiree really cranking into high gear when 
the Rockettes arrived before midnight, we all forgot about Grandma and 
Cousin Mel.</p>
<p>It wasn't until 9:00 AM on a groggy Christmas morning that Little 
Timmy noticed that Grandma and Mel never returned.  We tried calling 
Grandma on her cell phone and at her apartment, but got no answer.  
Alarmed, Dad called the police to file a "Missing Grandma" report.</p>
<p>Within an hour, the police called back and told us to meet them in 
Central Park near the bridge closest to Grandma's apartment.  When we 
arrived, we were horrified.  Cousin Mel was seated on a park bench, 
disheveled and crying, repeating, "The reindeer... that red nose... the 
jingle bells... Oh, the humanity!"  Grandma was nowhere to be seen.  The
 police showed us the only sign she left behind: her winter coat, which 
they had found at the scene of the attack with incriminating hoof prints
 on the back.  The crime scene photographer snapped a photo of this 
crucial evidence:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;">
<a href="http://pen-testing.sans.org/images/challenges/holiday/evidence.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="holiday-challenge_files/evidence.jpg" title="Evidence" border="0" height="300" width="400"></a>
<p><a href="http://pen-testing.sans.org/images/challenges/holiday/evidence.jpg" target="_blank">Click here to download the original photo file.</a></p>
</div>
<p>Our diligent local police agents quickly contacted the authorities at
 the North Pole, who obtained a court order to seize Rudolph's 
belongings immediately, including the computer he kept in his stable.  
Using that evidence, along with the eyewitness testimony of Cousin Mel, 
the prosecutor carefully built his case against Rudolph.</p>
<p>Based on Mel's description of the violent attack, after several weeks
 with no sign of Grandma, the authorities officially presumed that our 
dear Grandma had met her demise, a tragic victim of a reckless, renegade
 reindeer bent on destruction. </p>
<p>And that brings us back to today, here in the courthouse for the 
criminal prosecution of Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer.  The prosecuting
 attorney summarized the evidence, "The defendant's own computer system 
included geo-location data transferred from a cell phone showing that 
Mr. Reindeer was at the scene of the attack at the exact time that it 
occurred.  Further, we have hoof prints on poor Grandma's coat that 
match the defendant.  And, finally, we have the eye witness testimony of
 Cousin Mel, who witnessed the gruesome event."</p>
<p>With such detailed evidence and a carefully presented case against him, things were looking pretty grim for Rudolph.</p>
<p>And then, it happened.  Suddenly and quite dramatically, Little Timmy
 burst into the courtroom, arms flailing, waving a USB thumb drive in 
his hands.  He shouted, "Your honor!  I'm so sorry for the interruption,
 but I just discovered some potentially important evidence for this 
case."</p>
<p>"I object to this interruption," declared the annoyed prosecutor.</p>
<p>"Objection overruled, counselor," said the judge, "I am obligated by 
the official rules of Christmas-Special Courtroom Cliches to hear what 
this youth has to say.  Go on, young man."</p>
<p>Timmy explained, "My dear Grandma really loved computers.  Whenever 
we visited her apartment, we'd almost always see her blue and silver wig
 silhouetted by the soft glow of her computer screen.  Cyber attacks and
 defenses - she was a wizard at that stuff.  This morning, as we went to
 her apartment to collect her belongings, I noticed this USB token 
connected to her computer.  When I looked at its contents, I found a <a href="http://pen-testing.sans.org/xmas2011.pcap">packet capture file</a>
 that appears to have been created and updated Christmas morning... the 
very morning of the attack and Grandma's disappearance.  She always 
liked to keep track of her computer activity for troubleshooting 
purposes, so Grandma must have been running a sniffer that fateful night
 and following day.  I haven't been able to make any sense of the data 
in those packets, but I just know that something here will help us 
determine conclusively Rudolph's role in the attack and perhaps even 
Grandma's location!"</p>
<p>"Those are pretty serious statements, young man.  I'll dismiss the 
court temporarily while our technical experts analyze the evidence in 
more detail to help us get to the bottom of this case."</p>
<p>And that, dear reader, is where you get involved.  Fire up your 
favorite packet analysis tool, analyze this packet capture file, and 
answer the following questions to help determine Rudolph's guilt or 
innocence:</p>
<ol>
    <li>According to the <a href="http://pen-testing.sans.org/xmas2011.pcap">packet capture file</a>, what was Grandma's grand plan for Christmas day?</li>
    <li>Why did the geo-location information on Rudolph's computer, 
synced from his cell phone, show that Rudolph was in Central Park during
 the attack?  Please describe each technical step that lead to this 
"evidence" presented in court.</li>
    <li>Where should the authorities look for Grandma?</li>
    <li>Based on the evidence in the packet capture file, who is guilty in this story?</li>
</ol>
<p>Please answer each question by January 9, 2012, sending your results 
to GrandmaChallenge (at) counterhackchallenges.com with a subject of 
"Grandma Challenge".  From all submitted entries, we'll pick three 
winners, according to the following plan:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best technical answer</li>
<li>The most creative answer that is technically correct</li>
<li>A random draw answer selected from all entries</li>
</ul>
<p>Remember, even if you can't answer one or more of the questions, 
please do send in an answer of any kind to be entered in that random 
draw.  Winners will receive an autographed copy of the Counter Hack 
Reloaded book.</p> 
<p>Remember, Rudolph needs your help to sort out this matter and see that justice is done.</p>
<p>Merry Christmas!</p>
